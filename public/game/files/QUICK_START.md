- **Recommended**: 2-3 hours (photos, music, full customization)
- **Maximum**: As much as you want! Add Easter eggs, custom touches

## 🆘 Quick Fixes

**Photos don't show?**
- Put photos in same folder as HTML
- Use simple names: `photo1.jpg` not `My Photo (1).jpeg`

**Music doesn't play?**
- Click the "Start" button
- Music needs user interaction to start
- Try different browser (Chrome works best)

**Looks weird on mobile?**
- It's already responsive! Just test it.
- Might look different but will work.

**Something broke?**
- Undo your last change
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Check for typos in file names
